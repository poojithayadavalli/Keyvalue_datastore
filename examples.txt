#import mainfile as a library 

import datastore as x 
#"datastore" is the name of the main file 


x.create("one",1)
#to create a key with key_name,value given and with no time-to-live property


x.create("two",2,120) 
#to create a key with key_name,value given and with time-to-live property value given(number of seconds)


x.read("one")
#it returns the value of the respective key in Jsonobject format 'key_name:value'


x.read("two")
#it returns the value of the respective key in Jsonobject format if the TIME-TO-LIVE IS NOT EXPIRED else it returns an ERROR


x.create("one",10)
#it returns an ERROR since the key_name already exists in the database
 
x.delete("2")
#it deletes the respective key and its value from the database(memory is also freed)

#we can access these using multiple threads like
import datastore as y
y.read("one")
x.delete("one")

#the code also returns other errors like 
#"invalidkey" if key_length is greater than 32 or key_name contains any numeric,special characters etc.,
#"key doesnot exist" if key_name was mis-spelt or deleted earlier
#"File memory limit reached" if file memory exceeds 1GB
